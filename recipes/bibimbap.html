Additionally, Bibimbap may feature a protein source such as thinly sliced beef (bulgogi), fried egg, or tofu.</p>

<p>The dish is then garnished with gochujang, a spicy red pepper paste, and usually served with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and sometimes sliced nori (seaweed). To enjoy Bibimbap, diners typically mix all the ingredients together thoroughly before eating, creating a harmonious blend of flavors, textures, and colors.
