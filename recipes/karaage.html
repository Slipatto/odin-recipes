<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Japanese chicken karaage is a popular and delicious dish that consists of bite-sized, boneless chicken pieces that are marinated in a flavorful mixture of soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and other seasonings. The marinated chicken is then coated in a light layer of potato starch or cornstarch before being deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. The result is tender and juicy chicken with a crispy exterior.</p>

<p>Mayoster sauce, a combination of mayonnaise and soy sauce, is often served as a dipping sauce alongside chicken karaage. This sauce adds a creamy and savory element to complement the crispy and flavorful chicken. The combination of the savory karaage and the creamy mayoster sauce creates a delightful balance of textures and tastes, making it a beloved dish in Japanese cuisine.</p>
