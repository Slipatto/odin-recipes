Odin-Recipes

This is my first attempt at a project for 'TOP' covering the first
40 percent or so of the HTML curriculum.

In the creation of this project I will be using:

Git
Github
VSCODE
Command Line
HTML

The HTML portion will include:

Boilerplate HTML
Text:
    Headers
    Paragraphs
    Strong and Emphasized Text
Links
Images
...?
That's all that comes to mind.  This list will be revisited after
completion
